Understanding Oracle APEX 20 Application Development,http://www.allitebooks.com/understanding-oracle-apex-20-application-development/, Harry J. Foxwell, 148426102X, 2020, 112, English, Datebases,"Book Description:        Create good data from the start, rather than fixing it after it is collected. By following the guidelines in this book, you will be able to conduct more effective analyses and produce timely presentations of research data. Data analysts are often presented with datasets for exploration and study that are poorly designed, leading to difficulties in interpretation and to delays in producing meaningful results. Much data analytics training focuses on how to clean and transform datasets before serious analyses can even be started. Inappropriate or confusing representations, unit of measurement choices, coding errors, missing values, outliers, etc., can be avoided by using good dataset design and by understanding how data types determine the kinds of analyses which can be performed. This book discusses the principles and best practices of dataset creation, and covers basic data types and their related appropriate statistics and visualizations. A key focus of the book is why certain data types are chosen for representing concepts and measurements, in contrast to the typical discussions of how to analyze a specific data type once it has been selected. You will: Be aware of the principles of creating and collecting data Know the basic data types and representations Select data types, anticipating analysis goals Understand dataset structures and practices for analyzing and sharing Be guided by examples and use cases (good and bad) Use cleaning tools and methods to create good data"

Understanding Oracle APEX 20 Application Development,http://www.allitebooks.com/understanding-oracle-apex-20-application-development/, Scott Norberg, 1484260163, 2020, 416, English, ASP.NET Security,"Book Description:        Incorporate security best practices into ASP.NET Core. This book covers security-related features available within the framework, explains where these feature may fall short, and delves into security topics rarely covered elsewhere. Get ready to dive deep into ASP.NET Core 3.1 source code, clarifying how particular features work and addressing how to fix problems. For straightforward use cases, the ASP.NET Core framework does a good job in preventing certain types of attacks from happening. But for some types of attacks, or situations that are not straightforward, there is very little guidance available on how to safely implement solutions. And worse, there is a lot of bad advice online on how to implement functionality, be it encrypting unsafely hard-coded parameters that need to be generated at runtime, or articles which advocate for certain solutions that are vulnerable to obvious injection attacks. Even more concerning is the functions in ASP.NET Core that are not as secure as they should be by default. Advanced ASP.NET Core 3 Security is designed to train developers to avoid these problems. Unlike the vast majority of security books that are targeted to network administrators, system administrators, or managers, this book is targeted specifically to ASP.NET developers. Author Scott Norberg begins by teaching developers how ASP.NET Core works behind the scenes by going directly into the framework’s source code. Then he talks about how various attacks are performed using the very tools that penetration testers would use to hack into an application. He shows developers how to prevent these attacks. Finally, he covers the concepts developers need to know to do some testing on their own, without the help of a security professional."

"Mastering 3D Printing, 2nd Edition",http://www.allitebooks.com/mastering-3d-printing-2nd-edition/, Timothy Masters, 1484259874, 2020, 237, English, C & C++,"Book Description:        Discover a variety of data-mining algorithms that are useful for selecting small sets of important features from among unwieldy masses of candidates, or extracting useful features from measured variables. As a serious data miner you will often be faced with thousands of candidate features for your prediction or classification application, with most of the features being of little or no value. You’ll know that many of these features may be useful only in combination with certain other features while being practically worthless alone or in combination with most others. Some features may have enormous predictive power, but only within a small, specialized area of the feature space. The problems that plague modern data miners are endless. This book helps you solve this problem by presenting modern feature selection techniques and the code to implement them. Some of these techniques are:   Forward selection component analysis Local feature selection Linking features and a target with a hidden Markov model   Improvements on traditional stepwise selection  Nominal-to-ordinal conversion  All algorithms are intuitively justified and supported by the relevant equations and explanatory material. The author also presents and explains complete, highly commented source code. The example code is in C++ and CUDA C but Python or other code can be substituted; the algorithm is important, not the code that’s used to write it. What You Will Learn   Combine principal component analysis with forward and backward stepwise selection to identify a compact subset of a large collection of variables that captures the maximum possible variation within the entire set. Identify features that may have predictive power over only a small subset of the feature domain. Such features can be profitably used by modern predictive models but may be missed by other feature selection methods. Find an underlying hidden Markov model that controls the distributions of feature variables and the target simultaneously. The memory inherent in this method is especially valuable in high-noise applications such as prediction of financial markets.   Improve traditional stepwise selection in three ways: examine a collection of ‘best-so-far’ feature sets; test candidate features for inclusion with cross validation to automatically and effectively limit model complexity; and at each step estimate the probability that our results so far could be just the product of random good luck. We also estimate the probability that the improvement obtained by adding a new variable could have been just good luck. Take a potentially valuable nominal variable (a category or class membership) that is unsuitable for input to a prediction model, and assign to each category a sensible numeric value that can be used as a model input. Who This Book Is For Intermediate to advanced data science programmers and analysts. C++ and CUDA C experience is highly recommended.  However, this book can be used as a framework using other languages such as Python."

As the data science landscape shifts from using SAS to open source software such as Python, many users will feel the need to update their skills. Most users are not formally trained in computer science and have likely acquired their skills programming SAS as part of their job. As a result, the current documentation and plethora of books and websites for learning Python are technical and not geared for most SAS users. Python for SAS Users provides the most comprehensive set of examples currently available. It contains over 200 Python scripts and approximately 75 SAS programs that are analogs to the Python scripts. The first chapters are more Python-centric, while the remaining chapters illustrate SAS and corresponding Python examples to solve common data analysis tasks such as reading multiple input sources, missing value detection, imputation, merging/combining data, and producing output. This book is an indispensable guide for integrating SAS and Python workflows.
